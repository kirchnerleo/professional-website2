    <template #content>
      If you want to take a look at some of my work, you already have! The first
      iteration of this website was a project that was originally assigned as a
      final project for CS248 - Web and Internet Programming, which I took in
      the spring of 2023. The website utilized the various skills I learned over
      the course of that class, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. I
      wrote all of the sourcecode using Notepad++, and hosted it on the
      University of Wisconsin - Stout's development server before moving it to
      Nixihost for more permanent hosting. The project was challenging but
      extremely rewarding, both with regards to the final product and the skills
      I learned along the way. I'm always thrilled to learn something new, and
      this project was the perfect opportunity to do so. However, I decided
      early on that as my skills improved, I would continue to improve the site.
      What you are viewing now is the second and most recent iteration of this
      project. During my time working on our Software Engineering capstone
      project, my team and I worked with Prime Vue for our front end
      development, and I enjoyed using it so much I decided to remake my
      professional website using Prime Vue and Vue.js as a 2024 summer project.
