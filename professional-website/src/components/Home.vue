    I'm Leo Kirchner, a B.S. Computer Science - Interdisciplinary student at the
    University of Wisconsin - Stout. I started my college education at
    Normandale Community College in 2019, where I discovered my love for
    programming and computers. I transferred to Stout in the fall of 2022 where
    I will be finishing my degree. I'm always excited to learn new things, and
    in the ever expanding field of computer science, I'm confident I'll never
    run out of opportunities to expand my knowledge.
